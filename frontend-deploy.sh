# Google Cloud Run Frontend Deployment Script
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script builds and deploys the React frontend to Google Cloud Run.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) installed and authenticated.
#   - Docker installed and running.
#   - You have a GCP project with the required APIs enabled.
#   - The backend has been deployed and you have its URL.
#
# What this script does:
#   1. Sets configuration variables (project ID, region, service name).
#   2. Prompts for the backend URL.
#   3. Builds a Docker container for the frontend using Cloud Build. The
#      backend URL is passed as a build argument to be baked into the static
#      files.
#   4. Deploys the container to Cloud Run with production-ready settings.
#
# Usage:
#   ./frontend-deploy.sh
#
# ==============================================================================
